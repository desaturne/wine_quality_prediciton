This is a project submitted in the partial fulfillment of the requirements for 3rd Semester in BCT (Foundation of Data Science). 

__Objective:__  
Predict the quality of wine on a scale (e.g., 0 to 10) based on physicochemical properties such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and sugar levels.  


__Dataset__  
This dataset is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository and should be cited appropriately when used.

The dataset includes data for Portuguese red and white "Vinho Verde" wines, with variables based on physicochemical properties and sensory quality scores. This dataset can be used for classification or regression tasks, though the classes are imbalanced. 

<u>Both the datasets are considered</u>.

The dataset contains 12 feature  that includes:  
- Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): 
   1. Fixed acidity: Acidity level that remains after fermentation
   2. Volatile acidity: Acetic acid amount affecting taste
   3. Citric acid: Enhances flavor, adds freshness
   4. Residual sugar: Sugar left after fermentation 
   5. Chlorides: Salt content
   6. Free sulfur dioxide: SO₂ not bound and acts as an antimicrobial
   7. Total sulfur dioxide: Total amount of SO₂ (bound + free)
   8. Density: Wine density, related to alcohol and sugar content
   9. pH: Acidity level
   10. Sulphates: Contributes to microbial stability
   11. Alcohol: Alcohol percentage   

- Output variable (based on sensory clean wine dataset):  
   12. Quality (score between 0 and 10): Sensory quality score (0 to 10)
