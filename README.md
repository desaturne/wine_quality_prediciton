This is a project submitted in the partial fulfillment of the requirements for 3rd Semester in BCT (Foundation of Data Science). 

### Objective:
Predict the quality of wine on a scale (e.g., 0 to 10) based on physicochemical properties such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and sugar levels and give the output as high, average or low.

### Dataset
This dataset is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository and should be cited appropriately when used.

The dataset includes data for Portuguese red and white "Vinho Verde" wines, with variables based on physicochemical properties and sensory quality scores. This dataset can be used for classification or regression tasks, though the classes are imbalanced.

Both the datasets are considered.

The dataset contains 12 feature that includes:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

  Fixed acidity: Acidity level that remains after fermentation
  Volatile acidity: Acetic acid amount affecting taste
  Citric acid: Enhances flavor, adds freshness
  Residual sugar: Sugar left after fermentation
  Chlorides: Salt content
  Free sulfur dioxide: SO₂ not bound and acts as an antimicrobial
  Total sulfur dioxide: Total amount of SO₂ (bound + free)
  Density: Wine density, related to alcohol and sugar content
  pH: Acidity level
  Sulphates: Contributes to microbial stability
  Alcohol: Alcohol percentage
  Output variable (based on sensory clean wine dataset):
  Quality (score between 0 and 10): Sensory quality score (0 to 10)
